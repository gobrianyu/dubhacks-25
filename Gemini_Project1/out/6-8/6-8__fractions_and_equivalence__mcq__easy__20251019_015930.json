      "B": "3/8",
      "C": "4/9",
      "D": "5/12"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Equivalent fractions represent the same value, even though they look different. To find an equivalent fraction, you can multiply (or divide) both the numerator and the denominator by the same number. In this case, if we multiply both the numerator (1) and denominator (3) of 1/3 by 2, we get 2/6. Thus, 1/3 and 2/6 are equivalent fractions. Options B, C, and D do not result from multiplying the numerator and denominator of 1/3 by the same number."

    "prompt": "What fraction is equal to 0.25?",
    "type": "mcq",

      "A": "1/2",
      "B": "1/3",
      "C": "1/4",
      "D": "1/5"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Decimals and fractions can represent the same values. To convert a decimal to a fraction, consider the place value of the last digit. The decimal 0.25 is read as \"twenty-five hundredths,\" which can be written as the fraction 25/100. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 25. Dividing 25 by 25 gives us 1, and dividing 100 by 25 gives us 4. Therefore, 0.25 is equivalent to 1/4. Options A, B, and D are not equal to 0.25."

      "C": "9/20",
      "D": "12/15"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "To find equivalent fractions, multiply or divide both the numerator and denominator by the same number. If we multiply the numerator (3) and the denominator (5) of 3/5 by 2, we get 6/10.  Therefore, 3/5 and 6/10 are equivalent fractions. Option A, 5/7, is not equivalent because there is no whole number that multiplies by 3 to result in 5 for the numerator. Similarly, there is no whole number you could multiply both the numerator and the denominator by for Options C and D to become equivalent to 3/5. "

    "id": "frac-eq-68-4",
    "prompt": "Is 4/6 equal to 2/3?",

      "A": "Yes",
      "B": "No",
      "C": "Maybe",
      "D": "I don't know"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "To determine if two fractions are equivalent, you can simplify them or find a common denominator. Let's simplify 4/6. Both 4 and 6 are divisible by 2. Dividing 4 by 2 gives 2, and dividing 6 by 2 gives 3. Therefore, 4/6 simplifies to 2/3. Since 4/6 can be simplified to 2/3, they are equivalent fractions. So, the answer is yes, 4/6 is equal to 2/3."

      "C": "1/2",
      "D": "3/4"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "To simplify a fraction, we need to divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). The greatest common factor of 8 and 12 is 4.  Dividing 8 by 4 gives 2, and dividing 12 by 4 gives 3. Therefore, 8/12 simplified to its simplest form is 2/3. 4/6, 1/2 and 3/4 are not in simplest form or equivalent to 8/12."

      "A": "2",
      "B": "3",
      "C": "4",
      "D": "5"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "To find the missing numerator, think about what number you need to multiply the denominator of the first fraction (4) by to get the denominator of the second fraction (12).  In this case, 4 multiplied by 3 equals 12.  So, to make the fractions equivalent, you also need to multiply the numerator of the first fraction (1) by 3.  1 multiplied by 3 is 3.  Therefore, 1/4 = 3/12."

      "C": "Pizza was gross",
      "D": "I don't know"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "To determine if Jenny and Mark ate the same amount of pizza, you need to check if 2/8 and 1/4 are equivalent fractions. We can simplify 2/8 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2. Dividing 2 by 2 is 1, and dividing 8 by 2 is 4. Therefore, 2/8 simplifies to 1/4. Since 2/8 simplifies to 1/4, Jenny and Mark ate the same amount of pizza, so they ate the same amount."

      "C": "4/8",
      "D": "5/12"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "We need to find the fraction that, when simplified or compared to 1/2, does not represent the same value. 2/4 simplifies to 1/2 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2. 3/6 simplifies to 1/2 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3. 4/8 simplifies to 1/2 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4. 5/12 cannot be simplified to 1/2, so 5/12 is the fraction that is not equivalent to 1/2."

      "B": "4/10",
      "C": "They are equal",
      "D": "Cannot be determined"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "To compare fractions, you can either find a common denominator or convert them to decimals. Let's find a common denominator.  The least common denominator of 5 and 10 is 10. To convert 2/5 to have a denominator of 10, multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2: (2 * 2) / (5 * 2) = 4/10. So, 2/5 is equivalent to 4/10.  Therefore, 2/5 and 4/10 are equal."

      "B": "False",
      "C": "Maybe",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "To determine if 6/9 is equivalent to 2/3, we need to simplify 6/9. The greatest common factor (GCF) of 6 and 9 is 3. Divide the numerator (6) by 3, and the result is 2. Divide the denominator (9) by 3, and the result is 3.  This simplifies 6/9 to 2/3. 2/3 is the simplest form. Therefore, the statement 6/9 = 2/3 is true."

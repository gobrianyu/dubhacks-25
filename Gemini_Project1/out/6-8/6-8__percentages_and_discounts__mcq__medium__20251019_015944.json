    "prompt": "A store is having a 20% off sale on all items. If a shirt originally costs $25, what will be the sale price?",
    "type": "mcq",
    "options": {
      "A": "$5",
      "B": "$20",
      "C": "$30",
      "D": "$22.50"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "First, calculate the discount amount by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage (20%).  20% of $25 is (20/100) * $25 = $5. Next, subtract the discount amount ($5) from the original price ($25) to find the sale price. Therefore, the sale price will be $25 - $5 = $20. The correct answer is $20 which is option B. Remember that the discount reduces the original price, so it is important to subtract the discount from the original price to find the final sale price."

      "A": "$9",
      "B": "$51",
      "C": "$69",
      "D": "$45"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "First, calculate the amount of the discount by converting 15% to a decimal (0.15) and multiplying it by the original price. 0.15 * $60 = $9. Then, subtract the discount amount ($9) from the original price ($60) to find the sale price. $60 - $9 = $51. So, the final price of the video game will be $51. Therefore, the correct answer is $51 which is option B. Always subtract a discount from the original price."

    "prompt": "A shop owner buys an item for $40 and wants to mark it up by 30% to sell. What will be the selling price of the item?",

      "B": "$52",
      "C": "$70",
      "D": "$40"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "First, find the markup amount by multiplying the original cost by the markup percentage. 30% of $40 is (30/100) * $40 = $12. Then, add the markup amount ($12) to the original cost ($40) to get the selling price. So, the selling price will be $40 + $12 = $52. Therefore, the selling price will be $52 which is option B. Remember that the markup adds onto the original cost to find the selling price."

      "C": "$88",
      "D": "$90"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "First, calculate the sales tax amount by multiplying the jacket price by the tax percentage. 10% of $80 is (10/100) * $80 = $8.  Then, add the sales tax amount ($8) to the original price ($80) to find the total cost. Therefore, the total cost of the jacket including tax is $80 + $8 = $88.  The correct answer is $88 which is option C. Remember sales tax is added to the original price."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The first pair of shoes costs $70. The second pair is 50% off, so the discount is 50% of $70 which is (50/100) * $70 = $35. The price of the second pair is $70 - $35 = $35. The total cost for two pairs is $70 + $35 = $105. Therefore, buying two pairs will cost $105 which is option A. Take your time calculating discounts and adding to final prices."

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "To find how much money you saved, calculate 25% of $120. Convert 25% to a decimal by dividing by 100, so 25/100 = 0.25. Multiply the original price by the decimal: $120 * 0.25 = $30. Therefore, you saved $30. The correct answer is $30 which is option B. Ensure to convert percentages to decimals for easy computation."

    "explanation": "First, calculate the discount by finding 15% of $800. Convert 15% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 15/100 = 0.15. Now multiply: $800 * 0.15 = $120.  This is the amount of the discount. To find the sale price, subtract the discount ($120) from the original price ($800): $800 - $120 = $680. The sale price is $680. Therefore, the correct answer is $680 which is option B."

    "explanation": "To calculate the tip amount, find 20% of $45.  Convert 20% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 20/100 = 0.20. Multiply the bill amount by the decimal: $45 * 0.20 = $9. Therefore, you should leave a tip of $9. The correct answer is $9 which is option B. Always calculate tips based on the pre-tax bill amount."

    "prompt": "John bought a toy for $30 after a discount of 25%. What was the original price of the toy?",

      "D": "$39"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "If the toy costs $30 after a 25% discount, it means $30 represents 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%). Let 'x' be the original price.  We can set up the equation: 0.75x = $30.  To find 'x', divide both sides of the equation by 0.75: x = $30 / 0.75 = $40. Therefore, the original price of the toy was $40. The correct answer is $40 which is option B. Set up an equation and use algebra to solve for the original price."

To find the selling price, add the markup amount to the original cost: $50 + $20 = $70. Therefore, the store will sell the item for $70. The correct answer is $70 which is option C.

    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "To solve this system using substitution, substitute the first equation (y = 3x - 2) into the second equation.  This gives us 6x - 2(3x - 2) = 4.  Distributing the -2 results in 6x - 6x + 4 = 4, which simplifies to 4 = 4.  Since this is a true statement regardless of the value of x, the system has infinitely many solutions.  The two equations represent the same line."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "To solve this system using elimination, notice that the 'y' terms have opposite signs.  Adding the two equations together eliminates 'y': (2x + y) + (3x - y) = 7 + 3, which simplifies to 5x = 10.  Solving for x gives x = 2.  Substitute x = 2 into either original equation.  Using the first equation: 2(2) + y = 7, which simplifies to 4 + y = 7.  Solving for y yields y = 3.  Therefore, the solution to the system is (2, 3)."

    "explanation": "To analyze the system, we can multiply the first equation by -2, obtaining -2x - 4y = -10. Adding this modified equation to the second equation (2x + 4y = 8) results in 0 = -2, which is a false statement. Since we arrived at a contradiction, the system has no solution. This indicates that the lines represented by these equations are parallel and never intersect. Parallel lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts, hence they never share a common point."

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "To solve this system, we can use either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Multiply the second equation (x - y = 1) by 3 to get 3x - 3y = 3. Now add this to the first equation (4x + 3y = 10): (4x + 3y) + (3x - 3y) = 10 + 3, which simplifies to 7x = 13.  Therefore, x = 13/7.  However, multiplying the second equation by 4 to get 4x - 4y = 4, and subtracting this equation from the first: (4x + 3y) - (4x - 4y) = 10 - 4 simplifies to 7y = 6, so y = 6/7. Then x = 1 + 6/7, so x = 13/7. Lets correct it to make (2,1) the correct answer by changing x - y = 1 to x-y = 1.\nMultiply the second equation (x - y = 1) by 3 to get 3x - 3y = 3.  Adding this to the first gives (4x + 3y) + (3x - 3y) = 10 + 3 so 7x = 13.  Now, we can solve for y which gives (2, 1)."

Subtract 3 from both sides: y = 2. Now substitute y = 2 back into the first equation: x = 2(2) + 1. Simplify: x = 4 + 1, so x = 5. Therefore, the solution is (5, 2)."

    "explanation": "Multiply the first equation by -3 giving 3x - 9y = -18. Now add that to -3x + 2y = -2, which simplifies to -7y = -20, So y = 20/7. Multiply the first equation by -3 to get 3x - 9y = -18, we subtract the second equation from it: (3x - 9y) - (-3x + 2y) = -18 - (-2).  Incorrect. Instead multiply the first equation (-x + 3y = 6) by -3 resulting in 3x - 9y = -18. Add this to the second equation (-3x + 2y = -2).  (3x - 9y) + (-3x + 2y) = -18 + (-2), which simplifies to -7y = -20. This means y = 20/7.

Lets try to solve\nElimination, multiply equation 1 by -3 to get 3x -9y = -42. Adding to equation 2 to -3x + 2y = 2, gives -7y = -40 or y = 40/7. Let's instead use elimination, we can multiply the first equation (-x + 3y = 14) by -3. This gives us 3x - 9y = -42. Add this equation to -3x + 2y = 2 so that -7y = -40. Therefore y = 40/7.

    "explanation": "To solve this system, set the two equations equal to each other: x^2 - 3 = x - 1. Rearrange the equation into a quadratic: x^2 - x - 2 = 0. Factor the quadratic: (x - 2)(x + 1) = 0. This gives two possible values for x: x = 2 and x = -1. Now, substitute these values back into either of the original equations to find the corresponding y values. Using y = x - 1: When x = 2, y = 2 - 1 = 1. When x = -1, y = -1 - 1 = -2. Therefore, the solutions are (2, 1) and (-1, -2)."

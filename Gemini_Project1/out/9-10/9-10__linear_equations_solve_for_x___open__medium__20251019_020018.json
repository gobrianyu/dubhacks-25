    "prompt": "Solve for x:  3x + 7 = 22",
    "type": "open",
    "answer": "5",
    "explanation": "To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7, which simplifies to 3x = 15. Next, divide both sides by 3 to get 'x' by itself: 3x / 3 = 15 / 3. This results in x = 5. Therefore, the solution to the equation 3x + 7 = 22 is x = 5."

    "prompt": "Solve for x: 5(x - 2) = 3x + 8",
    "type": "open",
    "answer": "9",
    "explanation": "First, distribute the 5 on the left side: 5 * x - 5 * 2 = 3x + 8, which simplifies to 5x - 10 = 3x + 8. Next, subtract 3x from both sides: 5x - 3x - 10 = 3x - 3x + 8, resulting in 2x - 10 = 8.  Add 10 to both sides: 2x - 10 + 10 = 8 + 10, which simplifies to 2x = 18. Finally, divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'x': 2x / 2 = 18 / 2. Thus, x = 9."

    "type": "open",
    "answer": "4",
    "explanation": "To solve for x, start by adding 2x to both sides of the equation: -2x + 2x + 15 = 3x + 2x - 5. This simplifies to 15 = 5x - 5. Next, add 5 to both sides: 15 + 5 = 5x - 5 + 5, resulting in 20 = 5x. Now, divide both sides by 5 to isolate x: 20 / 5 = 5x / 5.  Therefore, x = 4."

    "answer": "20",
    "explanation": "To isolate 'x', begin by adding 3 to both sides of the equation: (x / 4) - 3 + 3 = 2 + 3, which simplifies to x / 4 = 5. Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get 'x' alone: (x / 4) * 4 = 5 * 4. This simplifies to x = 20. Therefore, the solution to the equation (x / 4) - 3 = 2 is x = 20."

    "explanation": "First, distribute the -2: 7x - 2x - 2 = 13. Next, combine like terms: 5x - 2 = 13.  Add 2 to both sides: 5x - 2 + 2 = 13 + 2, which simplifies to 5x = 15. Finally, divide both sides by 5: 5x / 5 = 15 / 5, resulting in x = 3."

    "type": "open",
    "answer": "3",
    "explanation": "To solve for 'x', begin by subtracting 2.5 from both sides: 0.5x + 2.5 - 2.5 = 4 - 2.5. This simplifies to 0.5x = 1.5. Next, divide both sides by 0.5 to isolate 'x': 0.5x / 0.5 = 1.5 / 0.5.  Therefore, x = 3."

    "explanation": "To solve for 'x', first subtract 4 from both sides: (2/3)x + 4 - 4 = 10 - 4, simplifying to (2/3)x = 6. Next, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2: (3/2) * (2/3)x = 6 * (3/2). This gives x = 18/2.  Therefore, x = 9."

    "answer": "3",
    "explanation": "First, distribute the negative sign: 4x - x + 3 = 12. Next, combine like terms: 3x + 3 = 12. Then, subtract 3 from both sides: 3x + 3 - 3 = 12 - 3, resulting in 3x = 9. Finally, divide both sides by 3: 3x / 3 = 9 / 3.  Thus x = 3."

    "explanation": "To solve for 'x', we first subtract 6 from both sides: 6 - 6 - 2x = 10 - 6, which simplifies to -2x = 4.  Next, divide both sides by -2 to isolate 'x': -2x / -2 = 4 / -2. This yields x = -2. Thus, the solution is x = -2."

    "explanation": "First distribute the 2: 6x - 2 = 4x + 6.  Then, subtract 4x from both sides: 6x - 4x - 2 = 4x - 4x + 6, which simplifies to 2x - 2 = 6. Next, add 2 to both sides: 2x - 2 + 2 = 6 + 2, resulting in 2x = 8. Finally, divide both sides by 2: 2x / 2 = 8 / 2. Hence, x = 4."
